## Work
Hi, I‚Äôm Monika, and I am thrilled about the digital world!

In my design practice, the main goal is to always think outside the box when doing primary research, finding keywords that can later help me connect with possible ideas, and creating either digital products, visual graphics, or identities. I enjoy working on various projects, but mainly, so far, web design or mobile apps.

See below for some examples of my work. ‚úåüèª

### Mobile App for National Gallery Prague
![Various screens displaying different states of the redesigned National Gallery Prague mobile app.](https://github.com/monica525/english-for-designers/assets/143282725/ee7a6097-51c8-481a-9f14-112ab90d987c)

A redesigned mobile app that enhances the overall art gallery experience for the visitor and encourages greater participation and attendance.

- **Problem:** The overall number of visits has decreased due to the lack of information about the artwork or understanding of what they see. This missing feature may have led to disappointment or frustration for the visitors. Moreover, the language barrier may have been another reason to visit the art gallery.
- **Action:** A redesigned mobile app that enhances the overall art gallery experience for the visitor and encourages greater participation and attendance. (Same as introductory sentence, rewrite and add value.)
- **Results:** The app redesign creates a better experience for visitors to enjoy their tour by scanning the art and offering audio in different languages.

### Balcan Crossover Movie Festival

- I did a visual campaign for the 2nd Balcan Crossover Movie Festival. I created a visual style of the poster with the message TRUE BALCAN EMOTION (ƒçist√° emoce) since the majority of balcan's movies are very emotional. The event was held at  Cinema Pritomnost in Prague 3. 
- The main idea was to celebrate diversity through typography: uniting the Balkans and embracing individuality. The typography celebrates the beauty of each individual, highlighting the rich tapestry of humanity within the Balkans. By utilising this typography, we strive to inspire dialogue, foster unity amidst diversity, and promote a deeper understanding and appreciation for the Balkan region.

- The game "Imaginarium" redesigns the famous board game with submarine theme. The type of game is visual and the goal of the game is not only to entertain and develop your imagination, but also to get to know your better your friends. The cards mainly contain colourful illustrations depicting submarine life, landscapes, and objects related to the ocean.The game time is around 30 minutes per round. Players are aged 10+ and can be played with 3-6 players. The game can be used at home or in the park, for example. The board is made of glass, the card is made of paper and the player figures are made of mod.
