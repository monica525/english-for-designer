## Work
Hi, I’m Monika . I am enthusiastic and ambitios graphic designer who helps comapnies to find creative concept solutions withing digital design.

In my design practice, the main objective is to always think otside of box when doing primary research, finding keyword that can help me to later conenct with possible ideas, and creation of either digital product, visual graphics or identity. I enjoy working on various projects, but mainly so far web design or mobile app. 

See below some examples of my work ✌🏻


### Mobile App for National Gallery Prague

- New mobile app that enhance the overall art gallery experience for the visitor and encourage greater attendance
- Problem: The overall number of visits has been decreasing due lack of information about the art work or understanding what they see. This can create disappointment or frustration for the visitors. Moreover, the language barrier can be seen as another reason to visit the art gallery.
- Action: New mobile app that enhances the overall art gallery experience for the visitor to encourage greater attendance.
- Results: Better overall experience for the visitor to enjoy their tour with scanning the art and having audio with different language options

### Balcan Crossover Movie Festival

- I did a visual campaign for the 2nd Balcan Crossover Movie Festival. I created a visual style of the poster with the message TRUE BALCAN EMOTION (čistá emoce) since the majority of balcan's movies are very emotional. The event was held at  Cinema Pritomnost in Prague 3. 
- The main idea was to celebrate diversity through typography: uniting the Balkans and embracing individuality. The typography celebrates the beauty of each individual, highlighting the rich tapestry of humanity within the Balkans. By utilising this typography, we strive to inspire dialogue, foster unity amidst diversity, and promote a deeper understanding and appreciation for the Balkan region.
