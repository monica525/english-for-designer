## Year in review 

The year 2023 was full of changes, including both my personal and professional life. Many new opportunities came my way for which I am grateful. There were very good times, but also harder ones, especially this year. I try to still look at the bright side of life and express gratitude every day while continuing to learn and explore the world. Everything is a bit more stressful now while finishing university and working on the side, but I believe I can manage. I am excited for the summer vacation though ðŸŒžðŸŒŠ
