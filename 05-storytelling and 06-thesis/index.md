# Redesign of Language Mobile App

#### Digital Design
For the last year, I got even more passionate about digital design and therefore, I decided to create a redesign of a language mobile app as a part of my final thesis project. I am very happy that the focus is especially on language learning as i always enjoyed learning new languages throughout my life.  I believe this is a great way how to better understand other cultures and to better communicate with more people around the world.

#### Current mobile app
The already existing app is called Movapp. The app helps mainly Ukraine people to learn the Czech language. Through my research I found some challenges: The current mobile app serves more as an online dictionary, incorporating elements of games like pexeso and listening to stories, such as fairy tales for kids. However, it lacks features such as a progress bar or the ability to level up skills, which are essential for motivating users to learn more. There is also no feedback or reward system. To keep them coming back.The overall UI/UX is not optimised and may result in poor user engagement and lower user satisfaction.

#### Solution
Redesign Movapp language that is more optimised for user needs. The aim is to make a personalised app as a learning platform, where users can learn from the basics up to a higher level. Moreover, other essential features would increase the overall engagement as well as create a more visually appealing design.

#### Sitemap
Sitemap is a visual tool that organises the content and structure of the new mobile app. And yeah I had literally to start from from scratch. I started with onboarding and the main four sections include the home page, learn, review and profile. I will talk more about each section later on.

#### Wireframing
Here is a sample of a few wireframes in low fidelity that I did to sketch my ideas for the functionality, structure and navigation of the app.

#### Design System
I created UI elements that are the core of the whole design identity. I created a new logo, icon, colours, typography, illustrations, etc. I wanted the users to feel that the design is fun, playful and modern.

#### App examples (improvisation), therefore just bullet points
- Onboarding / welcoming the user and seeing their preferences, getting to know him
-	Homepage: personalise widgets
-	Practice: reading, listening, speaking, writing
-	Profile section: current language, achievements, donate
-	Tone of voice and other illustrations

Thank you for your attention!
