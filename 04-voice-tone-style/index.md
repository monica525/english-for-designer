# Voice, Tone, and Style


## Voice
#### Personal
Once I establish a good connection with someone, I prefer engaging in interesting and meaningful conversations rather than small talk. I value genuine conversations that are fulfilling and involve sharing similar values

#### Honest 
I prefer to speak the truth rather than talking behind someone's back or being fake. In fact, it is very difficult for me to lie to someone. Therefore, I always strive to be honest with the people around me, while also taking the time to think before speaking so that the other person will not take it badly.

#### Curious 
I believe that asking is better than doing something you don't know, or pretending you do. I like to be curious and ask people around me to always learn something new, as I believe that no one is a genius unless you are Albert Einstein. Moreover, I like to explore and comprehend the world around me by asking questions or seeking new experiences.


## Tone
#### Respectful
I always like to talk with others with respect and dignity. I consistently show empathy when it comes to background differences, beliefs, or opinions. I enjoy listening attentively and speaking kindly while acknowledging the worth of each individual.

#### Friendly
I often smile when I talk to people and try to transmit good and positive energy. I believe that being nice, helping each other, or even offering a little smile can make someone else's day.

#### Emphatetic
I care about others' feelings and try to put myself in their shoes. I like to listen and offer support without judgment.


## Style
#### Using emoticons ðŸ™ƒ
I enjoy using emoticons to better express myself in conversations. Otherwise, it can feel a bit too serious or boring. You might even think, 'Is the person mad?' Just add ðŸ¤­ and you are sure that they are just kidding.

#### Informal
I enjoy more informal language as it is much friendlier. It's actually interesting how formal and informal language differs greatly in each language. When I lived abroad, I became so accustomed to speaking informally with my friends, and even teachers. In comparison to the Czech Republic, I feel we are much more serious and formal, using titles and such. I honestly prefer a more relaxed way of expressing myself. 

#### Sarcastic
Especially with close friends and fmaily membber, I like to use sarcasm while sending some funny meme, they really make me and other people laugh.. if they have similat kind of humor.
