### Hi, I’m Monika, an enthusiastic and ambitious graphic designer, digital artist and travel lover 💻 🖊 🌎.

I have always loved to do creative stuff since I was a small kid. Not having the best grades in math and doodling all the time during class made me realize that I would follow a more creative direction in my life. I am currently working as a graphic designer in a creative marketing agency, where I have a chance to do website creation, visual identity, and a bit of motion design

I genuinely like to grow and develop while learning from my mistakes and being inspired by the people around me. In the future, I would love to work in an international environment as I like to work with people from different backgrounds. Moreover, I am very enthusiastic about digital words, including UI/UX, and that’s a path I would like to follow in the future. In my free time, I love to travel to other countries, learn new languages, and get lost in nature 🌿. I enjoy finding inspiration in everyday life that can be applied to graphic design ideas later on ✨.

I would love to hear from you. E-mail me here:
