#### Hi, I‚Äôm Monika and I am an enthusiastic and ambitious graphic designer, multimedia artist and travel lover  üíª üñä üåé.
I have always loved to do creative stuff since I was a small kid. Having not the best grades in maths and dribbling all the time during class made me realise that I would follow a more creative direction in my life. I am currently working as a graphic designer in a creative marketing agency, where I have a chance to do website creation, visual identity and a bit of motion design.

I genuinely like to grow and develop while learning from my mistakes and to be inspired by the people around me. In the future, I would love to work in an international environment as I like to work with people from different backgrounds. Moreover, I am very enthusiastic about digital word, including ux/ui and that's a path I would like to follow in the future. In my free time, I love to travel to other countries, learn new languages and get lost in nature üåø. I enjoy finding inspiration in everyday life that can be applied to graphic design ideas later on ‚ú®.
