#### Hi, my name is Monika and I am an enthusiastic and ambitious graphic designer. 
I am currently accomplishing my last year at the University.Having digital design as part of my education made me realise that is an area that I would like to focus on in the future. Therefore, as for my final thesis, I have decided to focus on enhancing the ux/ui of a mobile application. Besides university, I am currently working as a junior graphic designer in a creative marketing agency, where I have a chance to do some digital design such as creation of a website that I truly enjoy and like to learn new things about typography, hierarchy, spacing and so on. Moreover, I create independent creative solutions for graphic projects, creation of graphic materials such as banners, infographics as well as a bit of motion design. I genuinely like to grow and develop while learning from my mistakes and to be inspired by the people around me. In the future, I would love to work in an international environment as I like to work with people from different backgrounds. Moreover, I am very enthusiastic about digital word, including ux/ui and that's a path I would like to follow in the future. In my free time, I love to travel to other countries, learn new languages and get lost in nature. I enjoy finding inspiration in everyday life that can be applied to graphic design ideas later on.
