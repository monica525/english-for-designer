#### Hi, I‚Äôm Monika and I am an enthusiastic and ambitious graphic designer, multimedia artist and travel lover  üíª üñä üåé.
I have always loved to do creative stuff since I was a small kid. Having not the best grades in maths and dribbling all the time during class made me realise that I would follow a more creative direction in my life. I am currently working as a graphic designer in a creative marketing agency, where I have a chance to do website creation, visual identity and a bit of motion design.

I genuinely like to grow and develop while learning from my mistakes and to be inspired by the people around me. In the future, I would love to work in an international environment as I like to work with people from different backgrounds. Moreover, I am very enthusiastic about digital word, including ux/ui and that's a path I would like to follow in the future. In my free time, I love to travel to other countries, learn new languages and get lost in nature üåø. I enjoy finding inspiration in everyday life that can be applied to graphic design ideas later on ‚ú®.

## Projects
Hi, I‚Äôm Monika . I am enthusiastic and ambitios graphic designer who helps comapnies to find creative concept solutions withing digital design.

In my design practice, the main objective is to always think otside of box when doing primary research, finding keyword that can help me to later conenct with possible ideas, and creation of either digital product, visual graphics or identity. I enjoy working on various projects, but mainly so far web design or mobile app. 

See below some examples of my work ‚úåüèª


### Mobile App for National Gallery Prague

- New mobile app that enhance the overall art gallery experience for the visitor and encourage greater attendance
- Problem: The overall number of visits has been decreasing due lack of information about the art work or understanding what they see. This can create disappointment or frustration for the visitors. Moreover, the language barrier can be seen as another reason to visit the art gallery.
- Action: New mobile app that enhances the overall art gallery experience for the visitor to encourage greater attendance.
- Results: Better overall experience for the visitor to enjoy their tour with scanning the art and having audio with different language options

### Balcan Crossover Movie Festival

- I did a visual campaign for the 2nd Balcan Crossover Movie Festival. I created a visual style of the poster with the message TRUE BALCAN EMOTION (ƒçist√° emoce) since the majority of balcan's movies are very emotional. The event was held at  Cinema Pritomnost in Prague 3. 
- The main idea was to celebrate diversity through typography: uniting the Balkans and embracing individuality. The typography celebrates the beauty of each individual, highlighting the rich tapestry of humanity within the Balkans. By utilising this typography, we strive to inspire dialogue, foster unity amidst diversity, and promote a deeper understanding and appreciation for the Balkan region.

- I decided to create own texture for this book edition. I used aquarell techniques, after scan it and adited in ps. I plaed with colorus so each edition can be different from each other. The whole design is abstarct while using organic elements.
