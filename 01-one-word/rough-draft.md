## Rough Draft

I always found the “impossible” very inspiring as it has its hidden meaning. At first, it can seem to look at something that is impossible or I cannot do something. On the contrary if we split the word, it says I’am possible, which carries a message of determination that we can do anything that we put our mind to it.
