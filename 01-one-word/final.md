I always found the “impossible” very inspiring as it has its hidden meaning. At first, it can seem to look at something that is impossible or I cannot do something. On the contrary, when we divide the word, it says  I am possible. This message carries the meaning of determination that we can do anything that we put our mind to it.

As we grow in our lives, we often find many challenges in our way, where the word “impossible” can often cross our minds. This feeling of doubting about our own capabilities to not be able to achieve something we want. From my point of view, the only limitations we might have are the ones we create in our heads. Therefore, it can be often up to our mindset and  beliefs, which can have an impact on our actions later on. 

I  believe that we can have two types of mindset with the way we approach life. It's like having two types of different glasses that kind of filter how we see the world around us. Some of us can wear glasses and often see the word impossible as limitation. This is the I cannot do attitude that can restrict us as I mentioned earlier. On the other hand, some wear glasses of possibilities and questioning: I don't know, but how can I do it? 

In conclusion, the word “impossible as a limitation” is a good way to show how our thinking changes how we see things. Whether we see it as a limitation or a challenge, we can either restrict ourselves from achieving our goals. Hence, is good to remember that nothing is truly impossible, as long as we believe in ourselves.

The takeaways can be seen as hidden optimism: The word "impossible" hides a positive message within, as breaking it down to "I'm possible" emphasizes determination and optimism.
