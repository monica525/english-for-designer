## Revision

In order t better edit my text in this section, I decided to use to answer 5 suppotive “Whys”?

What’s your hook?
What’s your thesis statement?
What are your whys and supporting points?
What’s your conclusion?
What’s your takeway?


### What’s your hook? 
- “Impossible” - word that has its hidden meaning.

### What’s your thesis statement?
- “Impossible” - at first, it can seem to look at something that is impossible or I cannot do something. On the contrary if we split the word, it says I’am possible, which carries a message of determination that we can do anything that we put our mind to it.
