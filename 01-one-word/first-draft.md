## First Draft

I always found the word “impossible” very inspiring as it has its hidden meaning. At first, it can seem to look at something that is impossible or I cannot do something. On the contrary if we split the word, it says I’am possible, which carries a message of determination that we can do anything that we put our mind to it.

As we grow in our life, we often encounter many challenges in our way, where the word “impossible” can often cross our mind. This feeling of having doubt about our own capabilities to not be able to achieve something we want. In my opinion, the only limitations  we might have is the one we create in our own head. Therefore, I think is often up to our human mindset how we look at it and the beliefs with have that can have an impact on our actions later on. 

I personally believe that we can have two types of mindset with the way we approach life. It's like having two types of different glasses that kind of filter how we see the world around us. Some of us can wear glasses that often see the word impossible as limitation. This is the I cannot do attitude that can restrict us as I mentioned earlier. On the other hand, there are those who wear glasses of possibilities and questioning:  I don't know, but how can I do it? 

In conclusion, the word “impossible” can be seen as a nice example of how our mindset can influence our perception of reality. Depending on whether we see it as a limitation or a challenge, we can either restrict ourselves or empower ourselves to achieve our goals. Therefore, we should always remember that nothing is truly impossible, as long as we believe in ourselves and our possibilities.
