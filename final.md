## Final

The word "impossible" has always held a special place in my heart. It's quite fascinating how a simple arrangement of letters can carry such profound significance. On the surface, it appears as a sense of  something that cannot be done. Yet, if we look closely, we can differentiate a glimmer of hope hidden within it. "I'm possible." These two small words, when put together, carry a powerful message of resilience and determination.


Life, as we all come to realise sooner or later, is a journey laden with challenges. It's in these moments of trial that the word "impossible" tends to rear its head, whispering doubts into our minds and planting seeds of hesitation. Nonetheless, it's essential to recognize that this word, though seemingly absolute, is not an absolute truth. It is more of a reflection of our mindset and perception rather than an inherent characteristic of reality.


I've always believed that the way we perceive challenges is deeply intertwined with the way we approach life. It's like having a pair of glasses that filter how we view the world. Some of us tend to wear glasses that see every obstacle with 'I cannot' attitude that can limit us. On the contrary, there are those who wear the glasses of possibility, questioning how something can be done. Those are adopting an attitude of 'I don't know, but how can I do it?' This being said, our mindset opens up the realms of the impossible and challenges the boundaries of what we believe can be achieved.


For me, the beauty of the word "impossible" lies in its hidden meaning. It serves as a reminder that the limitations we perceive are often self-imposed and limited within the boundaries of our own minds. To shift our mindset  from thinking I cannot to I can,  all we truly need is a shift in our perspective. In conclusion, the word "impossible" serves as a reminder that our greatest limitations often reside within our own mind. It encourages us to challenge ourselves, to push beyond the boundaries of what we believe to be achievable. With determination, persistence, and  belief in our capabilities, we can transform the impossible into the possible. So, let us embrace the power of "I'm possible" and embark on a journey that exceeds the boundaries of what the world seems achievable.
